# 🧠 Python DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms

My study notes and implementations while preparing for technical interviews.

## Implementations

| Category | Structure/Algorithm | File |
|----------|-------------------|------|
| 📦 Arrays | Two Sum, Sliding Window, Kadane's | [`arrays/`](src/arrays/) |
| 🔗 Linked Lists | Singly, Doubly, Reverse, Cycle Detection | [`linked_lists/`](src/linked_lists/) |
| 🌳 Trees | BST, BFS, DFS, Invert Binary Tree | [`trees/`](src/trees/) |
| 📊 Sorting | Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort | [`sorting/`](src/sorting/) |
| 🔍 Searching | Binary Search, BFS, DFS | [`searching/`](src/searching/) |
| #️⃣ Hash Maps | Custom HashMap, Frequency Counter | [`hashmaps/`](src/hashmaps/) |

## Running

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Why This Repo?

I believe in learning by implementing. Every algorithm here is written from scratch with:
- Clear docstrings explaining the approach
- Time/Space complexity annotations
- Unit tests for edge cases
